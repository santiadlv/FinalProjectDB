This project aims to fulfill the <b>Databases Course Final Project</b> requirements. It consists of two parts:
- An independent <i>SQL Server database</i>, containing records about professors and their respective grades and comments regarding their performance. It also has several views and stored procedures.
- A <i>C# .NET console project</i>, which connects to the database and aims to be a more friendly interface to execute all of its functions and procedures.

Alongside this two parts, there is a <i>Documentation</i> folder, in which you can find:
- An Entity-Relationship diagram of the database.
- A step-by-step guide to the normalization of this database's schema.
- This README file.

If you have any doubts, questions or complaints, please don't hesitate to contact us.
